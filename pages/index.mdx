Welcome to Canada's Digital Twin platform!

## What is Canada's Digital Twin?

Canada's Digital Twin platform is a web-based, non-proprietary system designed for the visualization and interaction of multi-scale geospatial information systems (GIS), open data, open building information modeling (BIM), and various other types of digital media, including text, images, and both animated and static 3D models, IFCs, etc. The platform employs full-stack web development frameworks, such as React.js for the user interface, state management, and memory optimization, and Next.js for file organization, routing, and server-side rendering (SSR).
